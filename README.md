## Key features about the Project
- Focusing on practical implementation based solutions. 

- Recent investigation revelead issues wiht rainforest carbon credits ranging upto 90%. TO ensure our offsets are demonstrably impactful and avoid even minor overestimations, we're proactively reducing our reported carbon capture by 20%. This commitment to transparency and accountability builds trust and delivers verifiable emissions reduction. 

- Users will be incentivized through a monetary reward system, recieving compensation for each tree they plant and maintain each year. Trees will be planted via classification model

- Calculation of carbon credits offset has been listed on the website for transparency. 

- Covers various fields like water, food, trees and carbon credits. 

- Promotion and awareness of water consumption at the household level, projected water conservation would be boosted by 30% according to surveys. Hence awareness would be beneficial.
